# Following 12/17/2019 cogsci conference

- The warm up activity went well. Might be good to add a few more items  all that makes sense and then make the last item be the desirable  50% rate but clearly poorly discriminating 

- Intro should probably start with what is item response data and examples of how broadly it can be defined (golfing, surveys, words, educational testing, delivery with fridges etc.)

- CAT seems to be of interest might add that in as an extension

- The rstudio cloud thing is static and not connected to github. Would be cool to make that happen. I have a blogpost on how saved in core gdoc.
